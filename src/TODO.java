06/17/17    CLOSED  AC -    Solution: I commented out the doAction function in the View class and added @Override to the doAction function of the MainMenuView subclass

                            Issue: I went through the assignment again and found a few typos. I'm having trouble with doAction in View.java
                            I'm not sure what to do with it... It looks like this change was made in the superclass instead of the subclass...
                            It's sect 9 on the assignment.


06/16/17    OPEN    AC -    Clean up the repo - do we need anything outside the Source Packages folder? -
